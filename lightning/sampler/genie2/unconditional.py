				-	aatype: 
						[N, 20] one-hot encoding on amino acid types. All amino acid
						types are set to 'ALA' since Genie 2 is sequence-agnostic.
				-	num_chains: 
						[1] number of chains in the structure
				-	num_residues: 
						[1] number of residues in the structure
				-	num_residues_per_chain: 
						[1] an array of number of residues by chain
				-	atom_positions: 
						[N, 3] an array of Ca atom positions. Atom positions of 
						all residues are default to the origin. 
				-	residue_mask: 
						[N] residue mask to indicate which residue position is masked
				-	residue_index: 
						[N] residue index (started from 0)
				-	chain_index: 
						[N] chain index (started from 0)
				-	fixed_sequence_mask: 
						[N] mask to indicate which residue contains conditional
						sequence information
				-	fixed_structure_mask: 
						[N, N] mask to indicate which pair of residues contains
						conditional structural information
				-	fixed_group:
						[N] group index to indicate which group the residue belongs to
						(useful for specifying multiple functional motifs)
				-	interface_mask:
						[N] deprecated and set to all zeros.
